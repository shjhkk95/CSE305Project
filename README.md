We used Nikhil's GUI to implement the PA3.
Notes about Project
- GUI was implemented using GUI provided by TA
- LoginDAO was not implemented --  information that relied on login info (such as getting session attributes such as customerID when as a customer in the home.jsp page) was hardcoded into controller classes for testing
You will have to hard code the title in the loginDao to login as different role.
- SubmitBid function not functioning properly -- improper access/user/pass
- Additional Person table added based on PA#2 solution w/ corresponding model, dao, controllers + extra viewPerson button on customerRepresentative.jsp
